Certainly! To work better with Portuguese, you should use a language model pre-trained on Portuguese text. SpaCy offers a Portuguese language model (`pt_core_news_sm`) that can be used for this purpose. Hereâ€™s an updated version of the code:

### Updated Code for Portuguese

```python

```

### Key Adjustments for Portuguese:
1. **Language Model**: We use `spacy.blank("pt")` to start with a blank Portuguese model. If you want to start with a pre-trained model, you can use `nlp = spacy.load("pt_core_news_sm")` instead, though in this case, we start from scratch to focus on custom NER.
  
2. **Training Data**: Ensure that the training data reflects the structure of your Portuguese texts, as shown in the examples.

3. **Annotation**: Portuguese-specific nuances, such as currency formats (`R$`), can be added to the training data.

4. **Iterations and Dropout**: The number of iterations (`20`) and the dropout rate (`0.5`) might need fine-tuning based on the complexity and size of your dataset.

### Considerations:
- **Pre-trained Model**: If you start with `pt_core_news_sm`, the model will already have some understanding of Portuguese syntax and common entities, potentially improving performance.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adjust the training process according to your specific data characteristics to get better results.
- **Model Size**: For a more powerful model, you can explore larger SpaCy models or even fine-tune a BERT-based model (like `bert-base-portuguese-cased` from Hugging Face) on your NER task.

This setup should work well for extracting product names and prices from Portuguese texts.
